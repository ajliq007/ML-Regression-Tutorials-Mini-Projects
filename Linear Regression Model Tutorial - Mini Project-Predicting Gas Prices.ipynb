    "### Introduction:\n",
    "Since the early years of humanity, there has always been a desire to predict future outcomes before they happened. The Ancient Greeks used Oracles, or divine priestesses, to predict the future by listening to their supposed messages from the Gods. The Ancient Chinese would engrave messages on bones, mashup and heat the bones, and then use the priest to interpret the answers returned by divine entities. While their approaches may have been different, the goal was the same: predict an outcome before it happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "As time went on, humanity developed and invented new fields of study related to mathematics and statistics. These topics would help scientist and mathematicians develop new ways to explore their world and devise more realistic means of prediction that were grounded in observations and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, all these models required data that could be measured and manipulated, something that was challenging to obtain before the advent of the computer. Enter the age of the modern computer, and data went from a scarce asset to an overly abundant commodity that required new technologies to handle and analyzes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of a large amount of data & powerful computers that could compute more numbers in a few minutes than a single person could in their entire life, meant we could make models more accurate and dynamic than ever before. Soon, the field of machine learning would take off as individuals realized they could create computer programs that could learn from all of this data. New models were developed to handle different types of data and problems, and a repository of new techniques could be referenced to devise new solutions to old problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the models we will discuss in this series is the Linear Regression Model. The Linear Regression Model attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation (a line) to observed data. In the model, one variable is considered to be an explanatory variable (X Variable), and the other is considered to be a dependent variable (Y Variable)."

    "### Background:\n",
    "In our example, we are going to try an model the relationships between two financial assets, the price of a single share of Exxon Mobile stock and the price of a barrel of oil. The question we are trying to answer is, does the explanatory variable (Oil) do a good job at predicting the dependent variable (a single share of Exxon Mobile stock.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why a linear regression model?\n",
    "There are so many models to choose from, why this one? Well there can be many reasons why we would choose a given model, but there were a few key reasons why a linear regression model is being selected for this example\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to know whether one measurement variable is associated with another measurement variable.\n",
    "We want to measure the strength of the association (r2).\n",
    "We want an equation that describes the relationship and can be used to predict unknown values.\n",
    "The linear model will take the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where each term represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y$ is the response\n",
    "$x$ is the feature\n",
    "$\\beta_0$ is the intercept\n",
    "$\\beta_1$ is the coefficient for x"

    "### Step One: Import our libraries\n",
    "To build our model, we will need some tools at our disposal to make the process as seamless as possible. We will not go through all the libraries but will take the time to explain a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas - This will make grabbing and transforming the data quick.\n",
    "Sklearn - We can leverage the built-in machine learning models they have.\n",
    "Scipy - This will make interpreting our output much more comfortable.\n",
    "Matplotlib - Visuals are critical to analysis, and this library will help us build those visuals."

The relationship means if one goes up the other appears to go up as well and also tells us it appears to be a positive relationship because they both move up. However, if we would like to attach a number to this relationship so we can quantify it. Well, in this case, let us measure the correlation between the two variables. We will take the DataFrame and call the corr() method to return a DataFrame with the metrics."

With these two functions we test the null hypothesis that the kurtosis of the population from which the sample was drawn is that of the normal distribution: kurtosis = 3(n-1)/(n+1) & the null hypothesis that the skewness of the population that the sample was drawn from is the same as that of a corresponding normal distribution, respectively.\n",

In other words, even if our dataset is slightly non-normal, we will reject the null hypothesis. These results are unrealistic because the chances of us having a perfectly normal dataset are very very slim, so we have to take these results with a grain of salt."
